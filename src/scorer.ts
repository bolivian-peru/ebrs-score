// ── v5.3 coverage shrinkage (survivorship-bias correction) ──
// A company with few computable signals has its weights re-normalized across
// ONLY the present signals. If the absent signals are the adverse ones (tax
// debt, late/non-filing, bankruptcy, ownership opacity), the raw score is
// inflated purely by absence of scrutiny - a data-sparse company could
// out-score a fully-examined one. v5.3 regresses the headline `overall` toward
// a neutral prior: each MISSING signal counts as a fractional neutral
// pseudo-observation. Full coverage (all signals) = no shrinkage; sparse
// coverage = strong pull toward neutral. Per-signal and per-axis scores stay
// RAW (they report measured dimensions); only `overall` is regularised for how
// complete the evidence is. Both constants are deliberately tunable.
